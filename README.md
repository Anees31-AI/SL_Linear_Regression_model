# 📊 Linear Regression with Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a **Linear Regression** model using Python and Scikit-learn. Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict **continuous values** based on one or more input features.

---

## 📌 Project Description

Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most widely used machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling. This project walks through the process of:

- Loading and preparing a dataset
- Applying Linear Regression
- Evaluating model performance using MSE and RMSE
- Visualizing results with Matplotlib and Seaborn

It uses an example like predicting student exam scores based on hours studied, and is suitable for beginners learning regression techniques.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**: Load the dataset and clean/format the data.
2. **Model Training**: Use `LinearRegression()` from Scikit-learn to train the model.
3. **Prediction**: Generate predictions for the test data.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
5. **Visualization**:
   - Scatter plot with regression line
   - Histograms of actual vs predicted values
   - Residual plot

## 📈 Example Results

- RMSE: `0.72`  
- MSE: `0.52`

These metrics help us understand how far our model's predictions are from the actual values.
